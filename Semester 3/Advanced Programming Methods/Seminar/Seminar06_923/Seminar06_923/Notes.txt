Comparasion & Comparable & Comparator

Comparable

    1. It's meant for default natural Sorting order
    2. present in java.lang
    3. Define only one method compareTo()
    4. All wrapper classes & String class

Comparator

    1. It's meant for customised Sorting order
    2. present in java.util
    3. Define 2 methods compare() and equals()
    4. Rules based classes

Wildcards (in generics, ? question mark) represents unknown type;
can be applied in diff situations as the:

    > parameter field or local var
    > as a returned type to a method

    We don't use wildcards:

        > as type arguments for a generic methods invocation
        > a generic class instance creation or a super type

Bounded (generic type) vs Wildcards (unknown type)

-> there is so called get and put principle

    There can be 2 types of generic wildcards:

    1. Upper bound wildcard (extends): can reduce/relax the restrictions on a variable
        Use "extend" keyword like <? extends MyClass> to apply Upper bound wildcard!
    2. Lower bound wildcards (super): restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a
        "super" type of that type
        Use <? super MyClass> to apply Lower bound wildcards!
        We can apply either upper bound on a wildcard or a lower bound.
        We can not apply both of them together.

-> USE 1.Upper bound wildcard: when you only get values out of a structure/collection
-> USE 2. Lower bound wildcards: when you only put values into a structure/collection

-> Do not use Wildcards if you want to read/write as well, instead use Bounded for that !!!
